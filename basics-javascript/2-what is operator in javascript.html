 ->addition 

 <p id="demo"></p>
 <script>
let y = 10;	
let x = y + 3;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Value of x is: " + x;
</script>

->Subtraction

<p id="demo1"></p>
<script>
        let a = 5;
        let b = a - 2;
        document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Value of x is: " + b;
        </script>
        
->Multiplication

<p id="demo2"></p>
<script>
        let c = 5;
        let d = c * 2;
        document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "Value of x is: " + d;
        </script>



->Remainder
<p id="demo3"></p>
<script>
        let e = 5;
        let f = e % 2;
        document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = "Value of x is: " + f;
        </script>
